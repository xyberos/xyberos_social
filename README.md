# Soccom

Soccom is a finite social communication platform. Phases 1–4 provide account identity, relationships, communities, threaded discussions, moderation, and an inbox-first chat experience.

## Stack decisions

- Web: FastAPI, Jinja2, and HTMX. HTMX enhances the profile save; standard forms remain functional without JavaScript. Alpine.js is intentionally not included until a real client-side interaction needs it.
- Mobile: Flutter is deferred until the web MVP is validated. Keep product rules in backend services; add a versioned JSON API before a mobile client is built.
- Persistence: PostgreSQL with explicit Alembic migrations. The application never creates production tables at startup.
- Identity: opaque server-managed session tokens, stored only as SHA-256 digests; cookies are HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, and Secure in production. Forms use session-bound CSRF tokens.
- Identity: email verification is disabled for the MVP. Registration signs users in immediately; enable verification before opening registration publicly.
- Recovery: one-time, hashed, 30-minute password reset tokens delivered by SMTP. Responses do not reveal whether an account exists.
- Relationships: follows and blocks are unique directed edges. A block prevents follows in either direction and removes follows already present between the two accounts.
- Communities: public communities are discoverable and joinable by signed-in users. Private communities do not appear in discovery and return a non-revealing 404 to non-members; owners and moderators can invite users by username. Owners alone can grant or revoke moderator roles; moderators can remove ordinary members. Administrative changes are audited.
- Discussions: community members can create bounded text posts and threaded comments. Post reads respect community privacy and block relationships. Authors can remove their own content; owners/moderators can remove content, lock discussions, review reports, and leave moderation events. Exact duplicate posts and rapid posting are rate-limited.
- Chat: the signed-in destination is the inbox, with persisted one-to-one and small-group text conversations, read state, and authenticated WebSocket delivery. Direct-message blocks stop new sends while preserving history. Group messages remain shared by active participants; membership additions, removals, and departures are auditable, and removed members lose live access without deleting history. WebSocket fan-out is process-local, so use one app worker until shared fan-out is added. Presence, calls, media, and end-to-end encryption are not in the current build.

## Local setup (Windows PowerShell)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and review the development-only settings.
2. Start PostgreSQL and Mailpit: `docker compose up -d postgres mailpit`.
3. Create the virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Direct dependency ranges are maintained in `requirements.in`; `requirements.txt` pins the tested environment.

4. Apply database migrations and start the app:

   ```powershell
   $env:PYTHONPATH = "backend"
   .\.venv\Scripts\alembic.exe -c backend\alembic.ini upgrade head
   .\.venv\Scripts\uvicorn.exe app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload
   ```

5. Open `http://localhost:8000`. Password reset messages appear at `http://localhost:8025`.

The Compose credentials are for local development only. Production settings require PostgreSQL, HTTPS, Secure cookies, and SMTP with STARTTLS. The built-in IP rate limiter is process-local; enforce rate limits at the edge as well, especially when running multiple workers. HTMX is pinned to a CDN release in the base template; self-host that asset before public launch.

## Checks

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "backend"
pytest backend\tests
```

The tests use an isolated in-memory SQLite database. Apply and verify Alembic migrations against PostgreSQL as part of local setup and CI.
